This can be useful if you want to be able to use your effect functions in isolation\n3) It will implicitly add an additional argument as the first parameter named `dispatch`\n\nThe arglist for `dispatch!` is `[type & args]`. Calling `dispatch!` will invoke the effect of `type` with `args`.\nThe role of `dispatch!` is to allow effects to define themselves in terms of other effects. Effects should not be called directly because while the default for an application is to use all the globally defined effects, this can be overridden for testing, development, or otherwise.\n\n\n  example:\n\n  (defeffect ::increment-number [$num]\n      (dispatch! :update $num inc))\n\n  \"\n  [type args & body]\n  (let [fn-name (symbol (str \"effect-\" (name type)))]\n    `(let [var# (defn ~fn-name [~'dispatch! ~@args]\n                  ~@body)]\n       (swap! effects assoc ~type ~fn-name)\n       var#)))\n\n\n#?(:clj\n   (do\n     (defeffect :clipboard-copy [s]\n       (ui/copy-to-clipboard s))\n     (defeffect :clipboard-cut [s]\n       (ui/copy-to-clipboard s)))\n   )\n\n\n\n\n\n(defui top-level-ui [{:keys [extra\n                             state\n                             body\n                             arg-names\n                             defaults\n                             handler]\n                      :as m}]\n  (let [extra (::extra state)\n        context (::context state)\n        args (apply\n              hash-map\n              (apply concat\n                     (for [nm arg-names\n                           :let [kw (keyword nm)\n                                 $kw (keyword (str \"$\" (name kw)))]]\n                       [kw\n                        (get state kw\n                             (get defaults nm))\n\n                        $kw\n                        (into\n                         `[(~'keypath ~kw)]\n                         (when (contains?
